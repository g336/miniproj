        <h2>About the Game</h2>
        <p>The game takes place in a sci-fi universe where players assume the role of a protagonist who joins a group of adventurers aboard a cosmic train called the Astral Express. This train travels through different worlds, each with its own unique environments, stories, and challenges.<br>
The player and their companions—who are referred to as "Trailblazers"—are on a journey to discover the mysteries surrounding the Stellaron, a powerful and dangerous entity that causes chaos and catastrophe wherever it goes. The plot revolves around combating the spread of the Stellaron and uncovering the forces behind its influence across the universe.</p>

        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Turn-Based Combat System : <br>
<p>Strategic Battles: Unlike Genshin Impact’s action-oriented combat, Honkai: Star Rail adopts a turn-based combat system. Players must think tactically about the order of actions, character skills, and enemy weaknesses to achieve victory.<br>
Team Composition: Players assemble teams of four characters, each belonging to a specific class or role like DPS (damage dealers), support, or healers. Success in combat depends on synergy between characters’ skills and abilities.<br>
Skill Variety: Each character has a set of skills, including basic attacks, special skills, and ultimate abilities. Timing and energy management are key, as using abilities at the right moment can change the course of a battle.</p></li><br>
            <li>Character Collecting and Gacha System
Gacha Mechanic :<br> 
<p>Similar to Genshin Impact, Honkai Star Rail features a gacha system where players spend in-game currency (or real money) to obtain new characters or powerful gear called Light Cones. <br>
Character Rarity: Characters come in different rarities, often rated by stars (3-star, 4-star, etc.). Higher rarity characters tend to be more powerful or have unique abilities, but even lower rarity characters can be essential depending on the player’s strategy.<br>
Character Development: Players can upgrade characters through leveling up, enhancing their abilities, unlocking new skills, and equipping them with powerful gear (Light Cones).</p></li><br>
            <li> Elemental and Path System <br>
<p>Elements: Characters and enemies in the game are associated with different elements like Physical, Ice, Lightning, Fire, Quantum, and Imaginary. Using characters with the right elements to counter enemies’ weaknesses is an essential part of combat.<br>
Paths: Every character follows a Path, representing their class or combat role. For example, The Hunt Path focuses on single-target damage, while The Abundance Path specializes in healing and support.</p></li><br>
            <li> Immersive Sci-Fi and Fantasy World <br>
<p>Astral Express: The game's central hub is the Astral Express, a space train that allows players to travel between different planets and regions. It acts as the base for Trailblazers and connects the worlds they visit. <br>
Planet Exploration: The game features several distinct planets, each with its own environments, culture, and stories. As players progress, they unlock new worlds to explore, each with unique challenges and lore.<br>
Open Exploration: While the combat is turn-based, players can freely explore open-world environments to complete quests, solve puzzles, and discover hidden items and lore.</p></li><br>
